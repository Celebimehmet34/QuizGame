Unity Quiz Game  

This project is a **Quiz Game** developed using Unity. The game includes questions from categories such as general knowledge, sports, history, and movies. Players must answer correctly to progress and achieve the highest score.  


Features:
Each question has 4 options.  
The player's answer is immediately evaluated.  
New questions load based on correct or incorrect answers.  
The player's score increases based on correct answers.  

  
The **QuizManager** class handles the core game logic:  
1. Loads questions: Random questions are selected and displayed at the start of the game.  
2. Checks answers: The player's answer is compared to the correct answer.  
3. Manages game flow: Loads a new question if the answer is correct, or ends the game after multiple incorrect answers.
